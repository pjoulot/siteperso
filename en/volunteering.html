        <p>
          On my free time, I invest a significant time for the Mozilla foundation and her mission. I go on events to hold the stand and talk about what Mozilla do and her mission. I also attend to community events like meetups, hackathon, MozFest or WednesdayDoc (Localize the MDN documentation). I also love to write code in order to extend Mozilla projects like Firefox OS app, browser webextension or aframe component.

        <p>During a hackathon in Mozilla Paris office, I helped to develop the Firefox OS app of Open Food Facts. Open Food Facts is a collaborative project which tries to list all the food products from all around the world.</p>

        <p>If you need a developer, don't hesitate to ask me and give me some informations about your project. If I love it and if I'm available, I maybe could give some help. If your project is related to online privacy, LGBT rights or environmental, I will likely be interested.</p>
