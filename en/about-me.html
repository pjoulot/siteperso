        My name is Philippe Joulot, I'm born in VÃ©lizy-Villacoublay in France and I live not far away in Viroflay. My passion for computer sciences and more precisely for the web gave me the wonderful job of software developer.

        I love write code and realise all sort of ideas that trough my mind. I also like to combine my other interests with coding. I develop mostly web applications and websites, but I also like to discover other technologies. I have a particular interest in Open Source and I like to spend some time to contribute for projects like Drupal, Aframe (WebVR) or Firefox OS.

        Concerning me, I love animals and in particular orcas that are my favorites. That explains the logo of this website. I'm also a big fan of TV shows, and I maintain some websites about this subject. I also participate to sci-fi and TV shows conventions where I love to meet fans from all kind of countries.
