    <h2>Computer sciences</h2>
    <p>My passion for computer sciences and more precisely for the web gave me the wonderful job of software developer.</p>
    <p>I love write code and realise all sort of ideas that trough my mind. I also like to combine my other interests with coding. I develop mostly web applications and websites, but I also like to discover other technologies. I have a particular interest in Open Source and I like to spend some time to contribute for projects like Drupal, Aframe (WebVR) or Firefox OS.</p>

    <h2>Orcas</h2>
    <p>I love animals a lot and in particular orcas that are my favorites. When I was a child, I discovered orcas with Keiko in the movie Free Willy, since then I have always admired this animal.</p>
    <p>That explains the logo of this website.</p>
